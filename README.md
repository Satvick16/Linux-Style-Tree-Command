# Linux-Style Tree Command

On the command line, the 'tree' command displays a well-formatted hierarchy of all directories and files within the current working directory.
My fascination for the speed and ingenuity of such features compelled me to replicate the source code for this command.

tree_script.py: uses recursion to display the file hierarchy formatted with indents

demo_dir: sample directory for testing the main script
